long-description: A progressive kids game that ages with your kids as they hit new "Boardgame Milestones". Dreams & Beyond starts out as your childâ€™s first game; a simple draw and move race to the finish. Then it progresses all the way to a tile laying, worker placement, engine building, resource management game with asymmetric roles. Each stage uses the same components as the last stage plus, a new component or two into the game. At each next stage, the players need not learn a whole new game but instead learn how the new components work and what new skills they need to master to be the winner! Open each new Stage Box only once your child has met the milestone goals for each new stage. (Imagine sealed legacy style boxes and envelopes) Good luck and have fun!
